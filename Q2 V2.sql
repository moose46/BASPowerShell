--Some accounts in MAS have one “matching” account in SalesLogix. 
--The actual names may not match so they are matched on the field
--in MAS AR_Customer.UDF_BWID  to the account number in SLX ACCOUNT.ACCOUNT_EXT.BWCUSTOMERID.
--I used an Access query to first identify which SLX accounts only had one account (see below).
--Then I used the results of that query to match anything that had a matching AR_Customer.UDF_BWID.
